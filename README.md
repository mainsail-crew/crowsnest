# crowsnest

A webcam daemon for Raspberry Pi OS Lite images like mainsailOS

---

## It inherited his name from Sail ships Crow's nest.

> A crow's nest is a structure in the upper part of the main mast of a ship or a structure that is used as a lookout point.\
> See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow's_nest

So, this will be the 'lookout point' for your Printer.

## Foreword

Thank you for choosing crowsnest as your stream service.

**Please read carefully on [how to configre](#simple-configuration) crowsnest to your needs!**

If you have any trouble that isnt corelated to my bad code :wink:
see [FAQ](#faq) section for first aid.\
Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mainsail) server if you need further help.

Do not open issues that are based on misconfiguration!\
This makes it harder for me to keep track of issues in my code.

Thanks in advance
Regards KwadFan

### Installation

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/mainsail-crew/crowsnest.git
    cd ~/crowsnest
    sudo make install

Tested on the following distributions:

-   Ubuntu Server 20.04
-   Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (Raspberry Pi Variant)
-   Linux Mint 21 (Codename: vanessa)

_If you test that on other Distributions, feel free to open a Pull Request to enhance Documentation._

After successful Installation you should consider to add

    [update_manager crowsnest]
    type: git_repo
    path: ~/crowsnest
    origin: https://github.com/mainsail-crew/crowsnest.git
    install_script: tools/install.sh

to your moonraker.conf, to get latest and possibly greatest Features.

### To uninstall 'crowsnest'

    cd ~/crowsnest
    make uninstall

### Are there more options?

Yes.

    cd ~/crowsnest
    make

or

    make help

For advanced users it is possible to configure the installer.

Simply run:

    make config

---

## Simple Configuration

---

All you need to get your Camera up and running is a small block of code in your _crowsnest.conf_\
In MainsailOS you can do that in mainsail Web Interface.\
Open the 'config' section, there should be the mentioned file.

By default it look like this:

    [crowsnest]
    log_path: ~/printer_data/logs/crowsnest.log
    log_level: quiet

    [cam 1]
    mode: mjpg
    port: 8080
    device: /dev/video0
    resolution: 640x480
    max_fps: 15

What that basicly means is:

    log_path: ~/printer_data/logs/crowsnest.log

**_NOTE: Do not change after Installation! This will prevent logrotate properly handling the log file rotation!_**

You can choose:

    log_level: quiet

This Option shows a bare minimum Logfile.\
For example:

    [06/16/22 09:57:01] crowsnest: crowsnest - A webcam Service for multiple Cams and Stream Services.

    [06/16/22 09:57:02] crowsnest: Detected 'Raspicam' Device -> /dev/video0
    [06/16/22 09:57:02] crowsnest: INFO: No usable CSI Devices found.
    [06/16/22 09:57:02] crowsnest: V4L2 Control:
    [06/16/22 09:57:02] crowsnest: No parameters set for [cam 1]. Skipped.
    [06/16/22 09:57:02] crowsnest: Try to start configured Cams / Services...
    [06/16/22 09:57:03] crowsnest: INFO: Configuration of Section [cam 1] looks good. Continue...
    [06/16/22 09:57:03] crowsnest: Starting ustreamer with Device /dev/video0 ...
    [06/16/22 09:57:05] crowsnest: ... Done!

The next option is

    log_level: verbose

This gives you a little more Informations.
It prints out you existing webcam.conf and shows
a detailed info about your configured ( and connected ) cams.\

You will find an example log [here](log-example.md).

This is useful to determine what the Hardware Encoder of your Camera is capable of.\
In this case a "cheap" raspicam for about 7â‚¬ was used.\
So, truly made for 'Helper for Setup' purposes.

If you want to get the full Details, please use

    log_level: debug

This will show you barely the same as 'verbose' but it prints also your\
configured Start Parameters ( and the defaults ), also it shows\
the Output of your choosen Streamer.\
This option ist more for debugging purposes and has a tendency to overwhelm you if you are not familiar with that.

---

Another Option that affects the 'logging' behavior is

    delete_log: true

If you enable that option, everytime you restart, your existing log file will be deleted.

If you want to run crowsnest without any proxy set up,\
you can use

    no_proxy: true

This forces ustreamer to listen on all available network interfaces.

---

Now the more interessting part.

    [cam 1]
    mode: mjpg
    port: 8080
    device: /dev/video0
    resolution: 640x480
    max_fps: 15

_**Note:** You can name the cam, how you want! ex.: [cam raspicam]_
**Attention: Do not skip the keyword 'cam'**

---

This section should be pretty much self explantory.

    mode: mjpg

means your choosen streamservice will be ustreamer with the well known mjpg-protocol.\
You can choose:

    mode: rtsp

This let you use external viewer like vlc for example.\
To view the stream use a proper player like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/).\
**The stream url will be _rtsp://\<printeriporname\>:8554/\<yourcamerasectionname\>_** \
As an example: _rtsp://mainsail.local:8554/1_ \
_NOTE: There will be no preview in your Browser!_

---

    port: 8080

This will only affect the used port of ustreamer.

**_NOTE: Ports 8080 - 8084 are covered by nginx reverse proxy in MainsailOS \
According to that 8080 will be /webcam, port 8081 will be /webcam2 and so on._**

---

    device: /dev/video0

This setting defines what video device will be used by the selected service.

If you are not using a Raspberry Pi then `/dev/video0` might not work and you might encounter an "`Video capture not supported by the device`" error in the `crowsnest.log` log file.

In this case you should use the direct device ID for the USB camera found in the `/dev/4vl/by-id` directory, like in the following example:

    device: /dev/v4l/by-id/usb-PixArt_Imaging_Inc._USB2.0_Camera-video-index0

Please be aware that all available devices are always listed in the `crowsnest.log` log file, so you can always copy the appropriate device ID from there.

---

    resolution: 640x480

Your desired FPS Settings has to match what your Camera able to deliver!
_NOTE: For the most part ignored in rtsp mode!_

    max_fps: 15

This last option only affects ustreamer:\
This needs some to read further Information.

    custom_flags:

If you enable this in your [cam whatevernameyouset],\
you can add parameters according to your needs.\
Those will be appended to the default/preconfigured parameters.

**_Note: These are seperated by a single space not comma seperated!_**

To setup Services to your need you have to take a closer look to the documentation of the Project.\
As a pointer in the right direction:

-   ustreamer

    -   For sake of simplicity I converted ustreamers manpage to
        [ustreamer's manpage](./ustreamer_manpage.md)

---

### Feature V4L2 Control:

    v4l2ctl:

This optional parameter allows you to setup your Cam due v4l2-ctl options.
Unfortunatly this is a complex topic. But I try to explain it, as good I can.

### As an Example

You own a Logitech C920 Camera, these camera needs some tweaks to get a sharp picture.\
A solution was to use a cronjob (timed actions due scripts) that runs a script with some v4l2-ctl commands.

    v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 -c focus_auto=0
    v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 -c focus_absolute=30

That script gets executed when th Pi boots up.\
Not a comfortable solution.

alexz from the mainsail-crew mentioned it would be a good move when \
this could happen by crowsnest, hassle free for the user.

Take a look at [alexz webcam.conf](https://github.com/zellneralex/klipper_config/blob/11f4f8db8ac0e273e25134b571d0a93291f3511e/webcam.conf)

So, here we go.
Simply add

    v4l2ctl: focus_auto=0,focus_absolute=30

to your camera setup section. \
Restart webcamd via mainsail (or your used UI) and you're good to go.

To determine which options or better said parameters your Webcam provides, set at least

    log_level: verbose

This will show you a list with available options. Like this:

    [04/02/22 15:07:44] webcamd: Supported Controls:
    [04/02/22 15:07:44] webcamd: 		brightness 0x00980900 (int) : min=1 max=255 step=1 default=128 value=128

    [04/02/22 15:07:46] webcamd: 		exposure_auto_priority 0x009a0903 (bool) : default=0 value=0

You have to "play around" with those settings if it matches your needs.
simply repeat the commands as mentioned earlier in your ssh connection.

If you have discoverd your setup write that to your webcam.conf as described.

## FAQ

---

**Q:** I get / keep getting Error 127 in line 31. What can I do?

**A:** Simple fix. For what ever Reason ustreamer wont start. Run the following commands please.

    sudo systemctl stop crowsnest.service
    cd ~/crowsnest
    make buildclean
    make build
    sudo systemctl start crowsnest.service

Did it work? If your answer is yes... Was easy right? :wink:

If it doesn't work for you, you probably updated a Debian "Buster" to latest "Bullseye" right?

Here is the catch, Buster uses a proprietary Firmware for the GPU called OpenMaxIL. This isn't included any more in "Bullseye".
These File are located in `/opt/vc`.\
Please backup these files and delete this folder by

    sudo rm -rf /opt/vc

Now run the commands mentioned in the beginning.

---

**Q:** I set `mode` to `rtsp`, but I get no stream in VLC. What should I do?
**A:** Read your log. If you are not using a raspicam or a camera with an inbuilt "H264" encoder, chances are equal to zero, to get a rtsp stream. Sorry :man_shrugging:

---

**Q:** I have twice the same model of a USB Cam, cant get both to show up. What can I do?\
**A:** Easy fix: Run

    ls -l /dev/v4l/by-path

Grab the two equal named devices, ending with `index0`

Use that paths as device path in your crowsnest.conf!

---

**Q:** How to install/use a Raspicam (V1/V2 are tested, HQ Variant untested)?

**A:** Well...
If your device is a Raspberry Pi, one of the mentioned Cameras **and** your OS is a Raspberry Pi OS based one, simply do nothing!
I tried as much as I can to reduce the steps to get that done.
Use `/dev/video0` as device in your _crowsnest.conf_
That is the device path I try to force for Raspicams.

---

**Q:** I use a Raspicam and a USB one but I cant get them both for unknown reason. How do I fix that?

**A:** My "force action" for Raspicams has a downside. If your USB Cam was attached before you extended a raspicam, the path `/dev/video0` is blocked by that USB Cam.

To fix that please unplug the USB one and reboot.
Plug the USB Cam in, after the stream of the raspicam is shown.
After that use the `/dev/v4l/by-id/<whateveryourdeviceidis>-index0` for the USB one and restart crowsnest.

---

**Q:** How do I contribute the best way?\
**A:** Well..-

1. Create an Issue related to your topic.
2. Prepare an _tested_ Pull Request against the develop branch
    - Please use commits formatted according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
    - Make sure not to ignore code formating as provided via .editorconfig of this repo
3. Be patient. Every PR has to pass some sort of "internal gates" before it will hit the master branch, unless an immediate reaction is crutial.

---

**Q:** But Kwad I want to support you in person, because \<fillinyourreason>! How?\
**A:** Buy me a coffee at [ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/U7U2GK66P)
