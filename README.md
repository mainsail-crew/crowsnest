## Why is it called crowsnest?

**It inherited his name from sailing ships crow's nest.**

> A crow's nest is a structure in the upper part of the main mast of a ship or a structure that is used as a lookout point. \
> See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow's_nest

So, this will be the 'lookout point' for your printer.

## Support

Please read carefully on [how to configure](https://crowsnest.mainsail.xyz/) crowsnest to your needs! Check out the [FAQ](https://crowsnest.mainsail.xyz/) section for first aid or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mainsail) server if you need further help. For some topics that are not covered in the documentation, just read below.

_**PS: Do not open issues that are based on misconfiguration! This makes it harder for me to keep track of problems in my code.**_

_If you test that on other distributions, feel free to open a Pull Request to enhance documentation._

#### Hint Buster

OS images that are based on Debian 10 (codename 'buster') are no longer supported with Crowsnest version 4 (current `master` branch)!

Please use the `legacy/v3` branch for these OS types.\
See the [README.md](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/crowsnest/tree/legacy/v3) of this branch for usage instructions.

#### Hint Bookworm

Raspberry Pi OS images that are based on Debian 12 (codename 'bookworm') currently use a different branch of [camera-streamer](https://github.com/ayufan/camera-streamer)!
The Raspberry Pi 5 has only [ustreamer](https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer) support! This is due to the missing JPEG and H264 Hardware encoders.

## Contribute

1. Create an Issue related to your topic.
2. Prepare an _tested_ Pull Request against the `develop` branch
    - Please use commits formatted according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
    - Make sure you do not ignore the code formatting as provided by the [_.editorconfig_](.editorconfig) of this repo
3. Be patient. Every PR has to go through some sort of "internal gates" before it reaches the master branch, unless an immediate response is crucial.

## CustomPIOS Module

I have decided to provide a [CustomPiOS Module](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS) to make it easier to integrate with other distributions like MainsailOS or similar. \
Please see [README.md](./custompios/README.md) in the module folder for more information.

## Credits

I want to give a huge shoutout to [_lixxbox_](https://github.com/lixxbox) and [_alexz_](https://github.com/zellneralex) from the [mainsail-crew](https://github.com/orgs/mainsail-crew/people). \
Without these guys it simply were not possible to get that done.

They both mentioned improvements and tested a heck out of there machines to get this all functioning well. \
Thank you, mates :) Proud to be a part of.

Thanks to [Pedro Lamas](https://github.com/pedrolamas), for the ISSUE_TEMPLATES.

Thanks to [ayufan](https://github.com/ayufan) for keep going on camera-streamer, even I stressed him to get rid of some bugs ;)
